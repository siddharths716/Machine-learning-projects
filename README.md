Artificial neural network : It predicts which set of customers are going to churn out from the organization by considering certain important factors.
                            Building an artificial network is way more accurate then other algorithms.

Image recognition: If a set of images of two different things is thrown at this model it will be able to identify or recognize a particular image.
                   Due to the dataset being two large it was not possible to upload it. Did provide the format of how dataset should be structured.
                   This model orignally could recognize between a cat and a dog but it is flexible enough to work with other objects too.

Insurance company premium: This model was made to identify which customer would pay the premium next month by training the model with 
                   a data of all the customers and taking into account certain important factors. 
                   
Titanic survivor predictor: One of the favourites, entering the required details this can very accurately predict a particular person would survive the disaster
                            if he/she was on the ship. This project uses graphical user interace to give it a unique element. This can tell whether you would
                            have survived the disaster or not!
